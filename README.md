# Maximize
Help people with CalFresh maximize their benefits

## Background on CalFresh

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, is the largest anti-hunger program in the country. In California, this program is known as CalFresh. The program provides approximately $250 a month for families to buy food.

Every year it raises 8.4 million people above the federal poverty line, including 3.8 million children.


## Overview of mRelief

mRelief is a tech nonprofit that provides an easy-to-use platform on web and text messaging for people to find out if they qualify and enroll in food stamps. Our mission is to restore dignity by transforming access to social services.

Our all woman software development team is focused on making an impact with technology while valuing diversity and inclusion.

## The Need

The purpose of this project is to provide helpful answers to all questions about the EBT card and help our users maximize their CalFresh benefits.

This website will be shared with mRelief users as soon as their benefits are activated.
